# Ekslistence

**Ekslistence** (= ekstdo + existence) is helper for writing a bar
that tries to provide a similiar API to [AGS](https://github.com/Aylur/ags).
I really like the AGS project and it has a very convenient API,
but my bar would segfault at random times which was very annoying.
So I decided to rewrite AGS in Rust with Slint.
